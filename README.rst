# Animated Octo Eureka

Prerequisites
-------------

* Docker; if you don't have it yet, follow the `installation instructions`_;
* Docker Compose; refer to the official documentation for the `installation guide`_.
* Pre-commit; refer to the official documentation for the `pre-commit`_.

Before Getting Started
----------------------
.. include:: generate-project-block.rst

Build the Stack
---------------

This can take a while, especially the first time you run this particular command on your development system::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml build

Generally, if you want to emulate production environment use ``production.yml`` instead. And this is true for any other actions you might need to perform: whenever a switch is required, just do it!

Before doing any git commit, `pre-commit`_ should be installed globally on your local machine, and then::

    $ git init
    $ pre-commit install

Failing to do so will result with a bunch of CI and Linter errors that can be avoided with pre-commit.


Run the Stack
-------------

This brings up both Django and PostgreSQL. The first time it is run it might take a while to get started, but subsequent runs will occur quickly.

Open a terminal at the project root and run the following for local development::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml up

You can also set the environment variable ``COMPOSE_FILE`` pointing to ``local.yml`` like this::

    $ export COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml

And then run::

    $ docker-compose up

To run in a detached (background) mode, just::

    $ docker-compose up -d


Execute Management Commands
---------------------------

As with any shell command that we wish to run in our container, this is done using the ``docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm`` command: ::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py migrate
    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser

Here, ``django`` is the target service we are executing the commands against.
